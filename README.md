## 🌐 Amazon Clone Learning Project (Archived)

This repository is an **old learning project** created while following the YouTube course  
**“JavaScript Tutorial Full Course - Beginner to Pro” by SuperSimpleDev.**

The goal was to build a simple **Amazon-style website clone** to practice the basics of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
I stopped working on this project on **June 2025**, and my skills have slightly improved since then so please don’t judge my current ability based on this early code 😄

## 🗂️ Status
**Status:** ❄️ *Freezing in Time — Not Continued*  
Development stopped on: **15/6/2025**  
The project is unfinished and contains many bugs. It remains here only as part of my learning journey.

## 🎯 Purpose
This project helped me learn:

- Basic HTML structure  
- CSS styling and layout  
- JavaScript functions  
- DOM manipulation  
- How an e-commerce page works  
- Following a full beginner-friendly web dev course (I think)


## 🐛 Known Issues
Because the project was never completed:

- Many features are incomplete or broken  
- UI layout issues  
- Buggy JavaScript logic  
- Stopped at **15/22 hours** of the course

## 📚 Why This Repo Exists
- To archive my early web-dev work  
- To show how much I've improved  
- To keep a reference for future projects  
- To remember where I started  
- Maybe I'll remake this someday… but realistically? Probably not 😂
